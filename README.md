**Cascaded Neural Memory ODEs for Predicting Fluence Maps in Rectal Cancer IMRT**

![Network Architecture](/img/network.png)

This repository contains the implementation of our proposed method using cascaded memory-augmented Neural ODEs for accurate fluence map prediction in rectal cancer IMRT treatment planning.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

- To train the model, please run:

```bash
./train.ipynb


## ðŸ”„ Updates

We will update this repository with more details, documentation, and trained weights once the article is accepted.

Stay tuned!
